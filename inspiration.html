          The Things to do are: the things that need doing, that you see need to be done, and that no one else seems to see need to be done.
          <br><br>
          &mdash; Buckminster Fuller
        </p>
        <p class="span6 offset3">
          The most dangerous thought you can have as a creative person is to think that you know what you’re doing, because once you think that you know what you’re doing you stop looking around for other ways of doing things.
          <br><br>
          &mdash; Bret Victor
        </p>
        <p class="span6 offset3">
          The best way for doubters to control a questionable new  technology is to embrace it, lest it remain wholly in the hands of enthusiasts who think there is nothing questionable about it.
          <br><br>
          &mdash; Stewart Brand
        </p>
          <p class="span6 offset3">
          […] an unstated question lies behind much of our current preoccupations with the future of technology. The question is not what will technology be like in the future, but rather, what will we be like, what are we becoming as we forge increasingly intimate relationships with our machines.
          <br><br>
          &mdash; Sherry Turkle
          </p>
          <p class="span6 offset3">
          Adapt what is useful, reject what is useless, and add what is specifically your own.
          <br><br>
          &mdash; Bruce Lee
          </p>
          <p class="span6 offset3">
          I try to push people to do new and different things. There has to be a culture where failure is fine if you thought it through and assessed the risks.
          <br><br>
          &mdash; Elon Musk
          </p>
          <p class="span6 offset3">
          I came to the conclusion that we should aspire to increase the scope and scale of human consciousness in order to better understand what questions to ask. Really, the only thing that makes sense is to strive for greater collective enlightenment.
          <br><br>
          &mdash; Elon Musk 
          <p class="span6 offset3">
          Familiar things happen, and mankind does not bother about them. It requires a very unusual mind to undertake the analysis of the obvious.
          <br><br>
          &mdash; Alfred North Whitehead
          </p>
          <p class="span6 offset3">
          The impact of space activities is nothing less than the galvanizing of hope and imagination for human life continuum into a future of infinite possibility.
