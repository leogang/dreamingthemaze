          The Things to do are: the things that need doing, that you see need to be done, and that no one else seems to see need to be done.
          <br><br>
          &mdash; Buckminster Fuller
        </p>
        <p class="text-left">
          The most dangerous thought you can have as a creative person is to think that you know what you’re doing, because once you think that you know what you’re doing you stop looking around for other ways of doing things.

          The best way for doubters to control a questionable new  technology is to embrace it, lest it remain wholly in the hands of enthusiasts who think there is nothing questionable about it.
          <br><br>
          &mdash; Stewart Brand
        </p>
          <p class="text-left">
          […] an unstated question lies behind much of our current preoccupations with the future of technology. The question is not what will technology be like in the future, but rather, what will we be like, what are we becoming as we forge increasingly intimate relationships with our machines.

          &mdash; Sherry Turkle

          Adapt what is useful, reject what is useless, and add what is specifically your own.

          I try to push people to do new and different things. There has to be a culture where failure is fine if you thought it through and assessed the risks.
          <br><br>
          &mdash; Elon Musk
          </p>
          <p class="text-left">
          I came to the conclusion that we should aspire to increase the scope and scale of human consciousness in order to better understand what questions to ask. Really, the only thing that makes sense is to strive for greater collective enlightenment.
          <br><br>
          &mdash; Elon Musk 
          <p class="text-left">
          Familiar things happen, and mankind does not bother about them. It requires a very unusual mind to undertake the analysis of the obvious.

          The impact of space activities is nothing less than the galvanizing of hope and imagination for human life continuum into a future of infinite possibility.
